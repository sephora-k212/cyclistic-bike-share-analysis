# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis🚴‍♀️

Welcome to my first GitHub Repository!

This repo is part of my portfolio ecosystem - it serves as the technical **backstage** of the Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study.

Here you'll find my R Scripts, BigQuery SQL queries, and additional resources that support the full analysis.

## 📊 Project Overview

This case study is based on a fictional company, Cyclistic, a bike-share service operating in Chicago.

The business objective was defined by the following key question:
> *"How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"*

The goal of this project is to explore user behaviour patterns to help inform a data-driven marketing strategy that increases annual memberships.

## 🛠 Tools & Methods Used
- **R** for cleaning and preparing over 5 million rows of trip data
- **BigQuery SQL** to efficiently query large datasets and generate summary tables
- **Tableau** for dashboard visualisation, to visualise trends and support final recommendations

📎 The full case study report and interactive Tableau Dashboard are available on my 
[portfolio website](https://datascienceportfol.io/sephorakelonga)
