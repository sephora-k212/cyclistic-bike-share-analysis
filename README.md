# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis🚴‍♀️

Welcome to my first GitHub repository!

This repo is part of my portfolio ecosystem — it serves as the technical **backstage** of the Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study.

Here you'll find my R Scripts, BigQuery SQL queries, and additional resources that support the full analysis.

## 📊 Project Overview

This case study is based on a fictional company, Cyclistic - a bike-share service operating in Chicago.

The business objective was guided by the following key question:
> *"How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"*

The goal of this project is to explore user behaviour patterns to help inform a data-driven marketing strategy that increases annual memberships.

## 🔑 Key Findings
- **Annual members** outnumber **casual riders** by approximately *1.5 million users*.
- On average, **casual rider** take trips that are **9 minutes longer** than those of **annual members**.
- **Wednesdays** see the highest number of rides from annual members, exceeding casual riders by approximately 300,000 trips.
  This, along with time-of-day trends, suggests that **annual members primarily use the bike-share service for commuting**, while **casual riders use it more for leisure.**
